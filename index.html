						<h3>Why this Blog?</h3>
							<p>Why this blog you ask? Well, I was just getting
								bored. And with nothing better to do than playing <em>PUBG</em>,
								I thought why not <strong>learn</strong> something instead of
								just playing games.</p>

								<p>If I loved having my head glued to
								screen so much, wouldn't it be better to learn somthing instead.
								Since both require doing the same thing: <em>staring at the
									screen</em>. The only difference being that the later is profitable
									and the former, a time-pass.
								</p>

									<p>So that's how it all stared.
									And here's the first project : <em><strong>A Blog!</em></strong>.
								</p>

									<p>This is still a work-in-progress. But I hope to complete it soon.
									Okay, that's all for the intro.
								</p>

								<p>Thank you for taking your time to read my post. I'd love to
									hear your thoughts on it and you know, <em>improve</em> it in if
									possible.
								</p>

									<p>If you are interested in learning too, or just want to give some
									tips and all, you can chat with me on Facebook or Twitter.
									The link is down below. You can also e-mail me by clickink on
									the contact button.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thanks you! Have a nice day!
